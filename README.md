# DesertSense

DesertSense is a modular IoT architecture designed to enable scalable, low-power environmental sensing in desert regions. Built around LoRaWAN communication and solar-powered sensors, the system enables autonomous monitoring of ecological and infrastructure parameters in off-grid, harsh environments.

Focus Areas:

🌞 Solar Farm Monitoring — Dust detection, performance tracking, irradiance sensing
💧 Water Resource Management — Groundwater, well status, and irrigation flow
🦎 Wildlife & Habitat Monitoring — GPS tracking and remote sensor telemetry
🛣 Infrastructure Surveillance — Road, pipeline, and facility oversight
📦 Architecture Overview

LoRaWAN-enabled sensor nodes (low-power, long-range)

Solar-powered gateways and edge nodes

Optional edge processing to reduce bandwidth needs

Designed for Sahara, Gobi, Chihuahuan, Tabernas and similar environments
