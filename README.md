# DesertSense

**DesertSense** is a modular, low-power IoT architecture for monitoring environmental and infrastructure parameters in arid and semi-arid regions. Developed under the **DenserMesh** organization, it leverages LoRaWAN communication, solar-powered sensors, and optional edge computing to deliver sustainable, autonomous data collection in off-grid desert environments.

## 🌍 Project Overview

DesertSense presents a scalable cluster of LoRaWAN-based use cases tailored to the extreme conditions of deserts like the Sahara, Gobi, Chihuahuan, and Tabernas. It provides a blueprint for deploying open, platform-agnostic IoT networks where traditional infrastructure is limited or non-existent.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- 🌞 **Solar Farm Monitoring** — Dust detection, performance analytics, irradiance sensing  
- 💧 **Water Resource Management** — Groundwater levels, irrigation control, well status  
- 🦎 **Wildlife & Habitat Monitoring** — GPS tracking and ecosystem telemetry  
- 🛣 **Infrastructure Surveillance** — Monitoring pipelines, roads, and remote assets

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

- LoRaWAN-enabled sensor nodes with minimal power footprint  
- Solar-powered gateways and optional edge computing for bandwidth optimization  
- Autonomous operation with passive energy harvesting  
- Platform-agnostic and adaptable to diverse environmental conditions

## 📘 White Paper
